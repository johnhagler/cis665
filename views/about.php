		<p>Hi there and welcome to ClimbIt!</p>
		<p>Are you a climbing enthusiast who enjoys spending more time on the crag working on new climbs than spending many hours online 
			looking for new routes that fit your grade and ability level? Then this site is for you. We know how important it is to be 
			able to plan your climbs and projects to work on and track your progress in order to make your climbing experiences most 
			memorable and fulfilling. So we made it our goal to provide a user-friendly, centralized place for fellow climbers to search 
			for routes and track their climbing experiences in the most convenient and efficient way. We do so by offering a comprehensive, 
			regularly updated online database on climbing areas, crags and routes across the United States. In addition, our site provides registered 
			users with the ability to log their climbing attempts, view logged climbs and track their progress overtime. </p>
		<p>As we strive to offer the best experience for our users, we would love to hear from you! Can't find an area, crag or route that 
			you would like to have listed? Have suggestions on the site use? Want to share a story about your recent climbing experience? We 
			are here to help you find your next climbing project and track your progress in the most effortless and fun way. So drop us an 
			e-mail and we'll be delighted to respond to any questions, recommendations to the site, suggestion on updates to the databaseâ€¦or 
			we are just as happy to simply hear your thoughts.</p>

				<h3>Anna</h3>
				<p>I first tried climbing in early 2012, fell in love with the sport after my first climb and quickly
					got my entire family into climbing as well. Since then climbing has become not just my passion, but a favorite family 
					activity for me, my husband and our two daughters, Elizabeth and Sofia, whose excitement about the sport and fearless 
					spirit motivate, encourage and constantly push me to the new limits. On a professional side, I am a financial 
					systems consultant by day. When I am not crunching numbers or climbing, I enjoy traveling, exploring new places and 
					experiencing new things with my family. Climb on and have fun!

					Hailing from the Pacific Northwest, I hold down the fort on the technical side, relying
					on Anna's spot on ideas on the content and user experience.  When I'm not heads-down coding
					until my eyes water, I enjoy the outdoors and training for triathlons.  However, I'm thinking
					about getting into rock climbing for cross training, and because it looks super fun.  And now I'll
					have an easy to use way to track my progress!  Looking forward to joining you all out on the rock!
